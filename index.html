        <h3>Bio</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>"I grew up in San Diego, CA."</h5>
              <p>I've always had an interest in computers, building my first tower when I was around 13 years old.  From there I learned about troubleshooting basic problems, and upgrading hardware.  As a musician, I gained experience in repairing my own instruments, amplifires, and basic audio engineering: this led me to pursue a carrer in the audio world.  After getting married, I craved a more stable profession that still challenged my skills as a problem solver; I worked for a moving company.  As a Foreman, I honed my skills as a leader and learned how to handle stressful situations in a professional way.  Now I have come full circle, and I will be taking my knowlege of tech to new heights as a software engineer.</p>
